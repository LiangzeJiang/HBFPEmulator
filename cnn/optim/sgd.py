class SGD(Optimizer):
    r"""Implements stochastic gradient descent (optionally with momentum).

    Nesterov momentum is based on the formula from
    `On the importance of initialization and momentum in deep learning`__.

    Args:
        params (iterable): iterable of parameters to optimize or dicts defining
            parameter groups
        lr (float): learning rate
        momentum (float, optional): momentum factor (default: 0)
        weight_decay (float, optional): weight decay (L2 penalty) (default: 0)
        dampening (float, optional): dampening for momentum (default: 0)
        nesterov (bool, optional): enables Nesterov momentum (default: False)

    Example:
        >>> optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1, momentum=0.9)
        >>> optimizer.zero_grad()
        >>> loss_fn(model(input), target).backward()
        >>> optimizer.step()

    .. note::
        The implementation of SGD with Momentum/Nesterov subtly differs from
        Sutskever et. al. and implementations in some other frameworks.

        Considering the specific case of Momentum, the update can be written as

        .. math::
                  v = \rho * v + g \\
                  p = p - lr * v

        where p, g, v and :math:`\rho` denote the parameters, gradient,
        velocity, and momentum respectively.

        This is in contrast to Sutskever et. al. and
        other frameworks which employ an update of the form

        .. math::
             v = \rho * v + lr * g \\
             p = p - v

        The Nesterov version is analogously modified.
